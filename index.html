		<h4> Thanks for taking perfect match!  So far, 2743 people have signed up for perfect match this year.  Here is a look at the results of this years survey and how they differed from last year.</h4>
		<svg height="500" width="800" class="generalBar"></svg>
		
		<h4 style="margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 30px;"> This year we asked participants to both rate their political tendencies on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the farthest left and 10 being the most right, and rate their political activity on a scale of 1 to 5.</h4>
		<svg height="450" width="800" class="politicalChart"></svg>

		<svg height="800" width="900" class="describeYourselfChart"></svg>
		<svg height="800" width="900" class="describePartnerChart"></svg>


		<!-- <h4 style="margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px;"> There's hope for people seeking partners of the same sex too. 14.7% of men and 14.6% of women who took perfect match indicated that they would like to be matched with a partner of the same sex.</h4>
		<svg height="500" width="800" class="genderPrefChart"></svg> -->

		<h4 style="margin-top: 25px;"> Participants were 60% more likely to say they were willing to meet their matches in 2021 compared to 2020.</h4>
		<svg height="450" width="800" class="commitmentComparisonChart"></svg>

<!-- 		
		<h4 style="margin-top: 25px;"> We have good news for people looking to get cuffed! We asked participants to give their commitment levels, and more than half of participants responded that they were willing to meet or planned to meet their matches. </h4>
		<svg height="450" width="800" class="commitmentBar"></svg> -->

		<h4> Participants also gave the minimum and maximum ages they would be willing to be matched with.  We expected men and women to answer differently, but we were not prepared for just how differently men and women responded. This is a look at how age preferences broke down by gender*.  </h4>
		<svg height="425" width="800" class="agePrefChart"></svg>

		<h4 style="margin-bottom: 50px;">In need of topics to fill that awkward silence? Here are the aggregate answers to controversial questions that we posed to our respondents. Do your answers agree with results?</h4>
		<svg height="800" width="800" class="polls"></svg>

		<!-- <h4 style="margin-top: 50px;">Based on how they responded to our survery questions, We also categorized students into 1 of 16 personalities on the Myers Briggs Type Indicator. While the science behind personality compatibilities is lacking, it is still fun to compare MBTI results with your perfect match as well as to see how you compare to students within your college. </h4>
		<svg height="500" width="800" class="heatmap"></svg> -->

		<h4 style="margin-top: 50px;">For better or worse, height is one of the first qualities that people evaluate when looking for a significant other. Interested to see how your height compares to other students' on campus?</h4>

		<h4>Need to know the best time to plan a date or make an impromptu phone call? Here is the aggregate data on when people are most likely to fall asleep and wake up. </h4>

		<h4>Thanks for taking perfect match this year!  Be sure to keep checking this page; we will continue to update it as more students respond. </h4>
